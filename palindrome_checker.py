# TASK: Write a program that checks if a word is a palindrome.

# Greet and prompt the user to enter a string 
word = input("Hello, and welcome to the palindrome checker.\nThis program will check if a word is a palindrome\n(The word is the same when reversed like: 'level')\nPlease enter a word:\n")
# Reverse the string by slicing  

# Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string  

# If they are equal, it's a palindrome  

# If they are not equal, it's not a palindrome
